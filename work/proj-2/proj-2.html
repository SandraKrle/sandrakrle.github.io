<h4>Work profile</h4>

<p>I combine my passion for user-centric design, a thorough understanding of the end-users and the experience to create a
sustainable and modern code base.
From web accessibility, responsive layout to clear navigation to function, my focus is on writing testable and performant code.</p>

<p>With my open communication and constructive feedback I am a valued team member that cares about the well being and smooth functioning of the team (and consequently, the code base). <strong>A happy team =
clean code base.</strong></p>

<p>I stay up-to-date on new technologies and approaches and have a strong will to change and grow with the
organisation and assignments. I work hard to make the most of every sprint with focus on details while understanding the
overall picture.</p>

<p>A healthy work-life balance boosts my motivation and productivity.</p>
