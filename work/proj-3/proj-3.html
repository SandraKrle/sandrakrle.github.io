<h4>Personal stuff</h4>
<p>So you’ve made it this far. Yay! Just some personal info here.</p>
<p>Born and raised in <strong>Skopje, Macedonia</strong>. Graduated and worked in finance for a long time (now feels like another life).
  Once moving to Sweden, I decided to become a developer ‘cause finance sucks.</p>

<p>My hobbies are watching movies and TV series. I try to visit the nature more often, but it’s so cold here.
  I also like hanging out with other humans, drink beer and listen to some good music.</p>
